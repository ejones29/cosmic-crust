- **TanStack Router** – Type-safe client-side routing across the pizza-verse.  
- **TanStack Query** – Data fetching, caching, and server state management that feels like magic. ✨  

### **Backend (Server-Side)**
Powering the Cosmic Crust command center:

- **Fastify** – A speedy and efficient Node.js framework for building APIs at warp speed.  
- **SQLite** – A lightweight and file-based database, perfect for storing planetary pizza data. 🧠
