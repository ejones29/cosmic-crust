# 🌌 **Cosmic Crust** – A Space-Age Pizza Experience  
*A premium UI/UX + full-stack portfolio project built for warp-speed cravings.* 🍕✨

**Cosmic Crust** is a fictional intergalactic pizza brand brought to life through a modern, fully custom React application. The project blends **high-end product design**, **cinematic visuals**, and a **modular, scalable frontend architecture** to create a restaurant-ordering experience that feels truly *out of this world*.

This repo includes a fully defined **brand design system**, a **cosmic visual language**, custom **animated UI elements**, and a strong emphasis on **modern frontend engineering workflows**.

The project is actively evolving as new features, galaxies, and toppings are discovered. 🪐
